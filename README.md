you can use BeginRecord to begin.Be careful,you must input right path and name. such as [D:/Webp/xg.webp],this directory must exist ,name must end with .webp
Then you can call EndRecord to wait tell you wheter to gengerate webp right or not .

do not BeginRecord at the same time. you must remember to call to call end .
